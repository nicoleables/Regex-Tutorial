## Description
This is about Regular expressions (regex) which are powerful tools used in programming for searching, matching, and manipulating text. They allow developers to define complex search patterns, making them invaluable for tasks like data validation, parsing, and transformation. In the regex.md file you will explore thr regex pattern /^([a-z0-9_.-]+)@([\da-z.-]+).([a-z.]{2,6})$/. This pattern is commonly used for validating email addresses. I will explain each part of the regexm including anchors, quantifiers, and character classes, to help get a better understanding on how it defines the search pattern for a valid email address.
